title: Starting This Blog
---

The idea is use this [blog](http://mailliststoc.github.io/) to share some ideas and I hope to get some feedbacks. That blog was made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Pole](http://www.getpoole.com/) with [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme. Interested? Check the posts of [Joshua](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) and [Bastiaan](http://qua.st/customise-jekyll-blog/) about it.

Just one quotation before start:

  > "Don't worry about what anybody else is going to doâ€¦ The best way to predict the future is to invent it. Really smart people with reasonable funding can do just about anything that doesn't violate too many of Newton's Laws!" - Alan Kay, 1971


I hope you guys enjoy the content.
